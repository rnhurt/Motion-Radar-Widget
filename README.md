Motion Radar Widget
====

This is a Mac OS X Desktop widget that shows an animated weather radar
map for your zip code.  Currently, it is configured to show only US
zip codes.

This is my first OS X widget and it's not very fancy, but it seems to work
and it scratched my itch.  Please use it and enjoy it and if you have any
problems with it don't hesitate to create a Github issue in this repo.
